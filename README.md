# hawkDoveBet

This is a betting contract where two individuals bet on some future outcome. They must each deposit a 'stakeAmount' and a 'betAmount'. Once the future outcome has occured, the individuals each report whether they won or lost the bet. If one reports a win and the other reports a loss, the winner receives both individuals' bet amounts and as well as the winner's stake amount.
